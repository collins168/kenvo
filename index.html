        <p>Working for KENVO has been a dreeam come true. all the wishers and day dreams of working here have been done by KENVO in our community now  I am part of that. Given a chance to live the dream and do my part for the community. To describe my current situation, I would say that am both exicited and nervouse. Exicited because of this great opportunity and nervouse because I want to do this right. More so i am hoping that this is the opportunity that I needed to grow my wings and soar high.<br />As a graduate with Bachelor of Technology in Environmental Resource Management, KENVO serves as the right platforn to grow my career. I have always desired to be on the ground Practicing the things learnt for i felt that theorioes were just not enough, I needed to get my hands on real ground work and test those theories. I view this platform as a trampoline that will bounce me to soat as high as gravity will allow and hoping that gravity will give me a free ticket to never ending soaring in the environmental conservation world.<br />Being a front office manager and membership officer at KENVO, gives me an opportunity to learn how to relate with people, Communicate, improve efficiency, increase organization, be dependable and most of all contribute greatly to ,y personal growth. I belive this will be a good starting point to whichever endeavour i will pursue in future.</p>

      <p>My career goal involves making change in my community in terms of solid wast management. I want people to use the same energy they use to ensure their houses are clean to their surroundings. Basically I want people to be aware of the cleanliness in their surroundings. What role does Kenvo play in my career? KENVO is a community based organization that has changed the way the community view their environmental especially in the forest sectour. Now the forests are thriving in Lari community and the community members are more willing to protect the forests for they understand the benefits they get from the forests. In the same ay KENVO offers me a platform to learn how to link with the community and change their mindset until the dream of an environmenment free of solid waste and full of great ways to manage that waste is realized. More so KENVO offers a myriad of mentors ready to offer their knowledge on working with the community and I plan to use this to the maximum capacity. What can i say I am hungry for knowledge and knowledge is power.<br/>It is said that success is not mesured by what you get but by what you give and i can't imagine what better way of being successful other than giving back to the community. Am very excited about this career  journey because it's looking very interesting from where am standing and if you happen to be reading this i would love to have you on this adventures journey.<br />P.S. The hand that gives is greater than the hand that receives.</p></div>
